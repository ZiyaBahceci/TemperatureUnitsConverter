# TemperatureUnitsConverter
A simple console program I've written in C++ to practice. 
I had made the same program with Java in the past, but as I learned C++ I wanted to rebuild it.
It includes 262 lines of code. 
It includes 4 temperature units to convert inbetween: Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit and Rankine.
Numbers are used to choose in the menu.
